        <h2 style="width:60%">Morris Wong was born and raised in Palmerston North, and graduated with a BSc from Massey
          University in 1985. Following a post-graduate Diploma, he entered the School of Dentistry at
          Otago University, where he completed a BDS in 1990. His first year working was as Dental House
          Surgeon at Napier Hospital followed by locum dental positions in Private dental practice.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 1992 Morris travelled to Hong Kong, primarily to study language and to experience the Chinese culture. What started as a 6-month visit eventuated into a 7 year stay, where Morris worked in a private medical clinic as well as completing his Masters in Periodontology. Towards the end of this period Morris headed a dental team as part of a 10-week medical project in the North West of China.
          <br>
          <br>
          Morris returned to New Zealand in 2000 and gained his specialist registration as a Periodontist. The next 15 years were spent working in a group practice in Wellington specialising in Periodontics and Dental Implants, and building up the Lower Hutt practice. Currently Morris is working full time in Lower Hutt, and serves as visiting Periodontist to Hutt Hospital, where he works primarily with the combined Cleft Lip and Palate team.
          <br>
          <br>
          Morris practices all aspects of periodontics and dental implants, and is a member of the New Zealand Dental Association, New Zealand Society of Periodontology, Australia New Zealand Academy of Periodontology, Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, American Academy of Periodontology, and the International Team for Implantology. Spare time is usually spent with family, involvement in the Anglican Chinese Church and writing periodontal reports. Current interests are skiing, snow boarding, tramping, running, basketball, and music. Morris is married, and has 3 children aged 16, 14 and 11. TO BE CONTINUED
