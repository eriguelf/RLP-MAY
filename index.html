      <h2>Hutt Dental Specialists is a small dental office with carefully selected Dental
Specialists. Originally this office was started by Morris Wong as a periodontal office
caring for a variety of gum issues and providing surgical support for referring
dentists. Today Hutt Dental Specialists have adapted to offer Oral Surgery, and
Orthodontic work through our visiting practitioners as well as an Oral Health
Therapist to support our periodontal patients.</h2>
<br>
<h2>We welcome patients who are seeking to find positive solutions to their oral health.
Care will be taken to work with you and find a solution to fit your personal needs and
find a home care routine to support any treatment that we provide for you.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Most of our patients have been seen by a general dental practitioner before they
seek treatment within our office. This is to ensure that you are seeing the Specialists
with appropriate skills for your care. You may however, refer yourself if you are
confident that you need specialists care.</h2>
<br>
<h2>All patient journeys within our practice will start with a consultation. Giving your
surgeon the chance to meet you and talk about treatment options will increase the
chance of successful treatment. In most cases there is more than one possible
approach and we wish to confirm your expectations before we move into treatment.</h2>
<br>
<h2>We understand that dental treatment is not the first choice for most people and we
are prepared to adapt our treatment to ease anxiety wherever we can. If you
experience difficulty with dental appointments please call our office and we will be
able to discuss how best to cater for your needs.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Providing the very best care for our patients is something our whole team enjoy.
Building a positive and lasting relationship with our patients is critical to our service.
We feel communication is a key building block in this process. We will endeavour to
deliver honest and essential information to you.</h2>
<br>
<h2>We are happy to welcome you as a patient and we look forward taking a dental
journey with you.</h2>

                <h1><b>Periodontitis: What is periodontal disease?</b></h1>

                <h2>Gum disease or periodontal disease is a bacterial infection caused by accumulation of dental plaque on the teeth. It is a disease that affects the gums and supporting bone surrounding the teeth. While periodontal disease does not cause pain it can lead to the deterioration of the supporting bone around teeth and allow teeth to become loose. The gums may become red, swollen and bleed easily, there may be a bad taste or smell from the gums.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pain is occasionally a problem if a periodontal abscess has formed around the root of a tooth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Periodontal disease is best treated under local anaesthetic by a periodontal surgeon. Your surgeon will endeavour to remove the cause of the problem by removing the plaque and bacteria from under your gums. It is essential for this treatment to be successful that you continue to have your teeth debrided of plaque and bacteria at regular intervals following the initial treatment.

                <h1><b>Dental Implants: What is a dental implant?</h1></p>

                <h2>Dental implants are used to restore the space left by missing teeth. They are a titanium replacement for the tooth root and they can support either a single tooth crown or sometimes 2 teeth bridge made by your dentist or prosthodontist. Dental implants can also be used to support a denture giving a very firm support to the denture and stopping any movement when eating or speaking. This can be provided with a single implant or more than one implant dependant on individual circumstance and preference.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are placed with a surgical procedure, usually under local anaesthetic, however we can offer sedation in some cases.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is occasionally the need to improve the bone where an implant is to be placed and this can be done with bone grafting. Sometimes this can be done at the time of placing the dental implant and sometimes it is necessary to do this as a separate procedure. Each case will be individually assessed and you will have opportunity to discuss this with your Periodontist before you begin treatment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dentistry in NZ commonly uses a synthetic bone, your own bone or a mixture of the two. If this is something that applies in your case your Periodontist will explain your options to you.

                  <h2>There are many causes of recession of the gums. Gingival grafting is the procedure to move gum tissue from once site to another in the mouth, most commonly to improve appearance if significant recession has occurred. Gingival grafting is not always possible and careful consultation with a Periodontist is necessary to discuss the treatment options and outcomes. A Periodontist will be able to give you a realistic expectation of the outcome before your make a decision regarding this treatment or if this treatment will give the best result for your personal case.

                  <h2>The band of tissue lying between the upper front teeth known as the ‘frenum’. You will find the frenum connecting the inside of the upper lip to the gum tissue between the roots of the upper front teeth or similarly between the centre of the inside of your lower lip and the centre of your lower gums. Normally the frenum blends into the gum tissue well above the level of the teeth. The procedure used to remove this tissue is known as a “frenectomy.” Frenectomy is used when there is a need to allow the lip more movement or if the frenum is causing an unwanted gap between the front teeth. Similarly, this can be done with the lower lip for the same reasons.

This done to give a better aesthetic to front teeth and occasionally for functional reasons with molar teeth.

                  <p>Periocision is a procedure done after orthodontic treatment. The periodontist will removed some of the ligament connecting the tooth to the surrounding bone. This allows the tooth to settle into the position achieved through orthodontic treatment, and not return to the original position. This will help to maintain ‘straight’ teeth long after orthodontic treatment is completed.

This is most common with the canine teeth and often they need some help to come through. They are often high up behind the lip or lay across the palate. The periodontist will removed the gum and bone blocking the tooth from emerging in the right place and return the patient to the orthodontist to complete the movement of the tooth.
